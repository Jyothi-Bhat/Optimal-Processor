# Optimal-Processor
Stratergy to get the best processor in town.
Number of ways, write stratergy and burst length are taken into consideration.
Cholesky decomposition method is used for 256*256 matrix of random data.
The random matrix of 256 is obtained from the matlab code.
Total running time for cholesky decomposition data is around 50 mins.
Best time obtained for i7 processor is 0.8 seconds and worst time is 13 seconds.
