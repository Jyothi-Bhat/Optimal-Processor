# Optimal-Processor
stratergy to get the best processor in town
number of ways, write stratergy and burst length are taken into consideration
cholesky decomposition method is used for 256*256 matrix of random data
the matrix is obtained from the matlab code
total running time for cholesky decomposition data is around 50 mins
