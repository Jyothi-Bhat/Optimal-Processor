# Optimal-Processor
Stratergy to get the best processor in town.
Number of ways, write stratergy and burst length are taken into consideration.
Cholesky decomposition method is used for 256*256 matrix of random data.
The matrix is obtained from the matlab code.
Total running time for cholesky decomposition data is around 50 mins.
